# Cartpole game by OpenAi with the Q-learning algorithm applied

This repository contains the algorithm i used to train a neural network to performe the cartpole game. The cartpole game is a game where you have to balance a pole on a cart. To do so you can accelerate the the cart to the left or to the right. In my case I applied the Q-Learning algorithm on it and it reached the maximum score of 498 steps.

Just try it out yourself with the trained model or train it on your own machine. The whole code is commented but if you have any questions just contact me
